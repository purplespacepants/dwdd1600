    <!--for value don't put submit bc most people dont know what submit means so say "send delivery request" cuz it's more person friendly
    dr cheney is a nerd and uses myForm but dr [] doesn't like it because it's easy to get wrong
    most people don't use the get method because it's not secure.
    
    we just built a thanks page
