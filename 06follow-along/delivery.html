<!--fieldset is like a div, look more up later-->
    <fieldset>
        <input type="text" name="first_name" >
    
    </fieldset>
    
    
    <input type="submit" value="Send Delivery Request">
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <!--for value don't put submit bc most people dont know what submit means so say "send delivery request" cuz it's more person friendly
    dr cheney is a nerd and uses myForm but dr [] doesn't like it because it's easy to get wrong
    most people don't use the get method because it's not secure.
    
    we just built a thanks page
