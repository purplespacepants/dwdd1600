        <div class="div1">
            <h3 class="handjet-heading3">So what's my deal?</h3>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3 class="handjet-heading3">Why I do art</h3>
        <p>I have to. I can't not. If you aren't doing art I would encourage you take a look inside yourself to find out
            why. Is it because you're scared of failing? Nice job doofus, you've made yourself miserable for no reason.
            Art
            doesn't just belong in a gallery. It belongs in your home. In your heart. In your hands. <strong>Art is
                human</strong>, and not just <em>Homo sapiens</em> human. Do you think you're better than art? Than
            artists? Or are you scared of looking too long in the mirror of your own creations? Don't be scared of
            yourself.
            Don't be afraid of being human.</p>

        <h3 class="handjet-heading3">Top 10 Reasons You Should Do Art</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>You have thoughts that can't be said in simple words.</li>
                <li>You have lost something or someone you love.</li>
                <li>You must at some point connect yourself with the rest of humanity, past and present.</li>
                <li>You are angry.</li>
                <li>You are tired.</li>

            <p><em>For some solid examples of these terms, visit <a
                        href="https://theartteacher.net/2024/01/21/the-formal-elements-of-art/"
                        target="blank">theartteacher.net</a></em></p>
            <br>
            <dl>
                <dt>Line</dt>
                <dd>You know what a line is, but what's important is what it <em>does</em>. Is it long or short? Curved
                    or
                    jagged? Was it made with a thin pen or a thick brush? Does it vary in thickness? Where does it
                    point? Where
                    does it start and end? These are all important things to think about when assessing the lines in a
                    work of
                    art.</dd>
                <dt>Shape</dt>
                <dd>Shape refers to the two-dimensional aspects of a work. Think circles and squares and triangles. A
                    shape is a
                    space that lines make together, forming a fenced off area. What kinds of shapes do you see?</dd>
                <dt>Form</dt>
                <dd>This is the depth of a work. It can be literal as in the 3d form of a sculpture, or a trick of the
                    eye in
                    the way that an artist can paint something that looks like it's going back in space.</dd>
                <dt>Color</dt>
                <dd>Color is made up of hue, value, and saturation. The hue is the broad answer to the question "what
                    color is
                    that?" Perhaps the answer would just be "green." The value is its lightness or darkness. The
                    saturation is
                    how vibrant the color is.</dd>
                <dt>Tone/Value</dt>
                <dd>This is how light or dark any part of a work is, areas big or small. Controlling tone is what
                    creates the
                    illusion of form.</dd>
                <dt>Texture</dt>
                <dd>That's what you'll feel if you touch the work. Bumpy, smooth, sharp, and things like that. You won't
                    usually
                    be touching an artwork, but if you can see it well then you can usually infer the texture.</dd>
                <dt>Space</dt>
                <dd>Space refers to the stuff that's there and the stuff that isn't. Think of a window. How big is the
                    window?
                    The window divides the work into negative space(the hole that the window creates in the wall) and
                    positive
                    space (the wall itself).</dd>
