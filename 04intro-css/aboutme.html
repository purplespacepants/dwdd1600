    </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="handjet-heading3">Why I do art</h3>
    <p>I have to. I can't not. If you aren't doing art I would encourage you take a look inside yourself to find out
        why. Is it because you're scared of failing? Nice job doofus, you've made yourself miserable for no reason. Art
        doesn't just belong in a gallery. It belongs in your home. In your heart. In your hands. <strong>Art is
            human</strong>, and not just <em>Homo sapiens</em> human. Do you think you're better than art? Than
        artists? Or are you scared of looking too long in the mirror of your own creations? Don't be scared of yourself.
        Don't be afraid of being human.</p>

    <h3 class="handjet-heading3">Top 10 Reasons You Should Do Art</h3>
    <div class="div1">
    <ol>
        <li>You have thoughts that can't be said in simple words.</li>
        <li>You have lost something or someone you love.</li>
        <li>You must at some point connect yourself with the rest of humanity, past and present.</li>
        <li>You are angry.</li>
        <li>You are tired.</li>
        <li>You are happy.</li>
        <li>You like music.</li>
        <li>You will surprise yourself.</li>
        <li>You will have something to keep that holds a good memory.</li>
        <li>You will have something to destroy that holds a bad memory.</li>

    <h3>The big art words you should know</h3>
    <div class="div1">
    <p><em>For some solid examples of these terms, visit <a
                href="https://theartteacher.net/2024/01/21/the-formal-elements-of-art/"
                target="blank">theartteacher.net</a></em></p> 
                <br>
    <dl>
        <dt>Line</dt>
        <dd>You know what a line is, but what's important is what it <em>does</em>. Is it long or short? Curved or
            jagged? Was it made with a thin pen or a thick brush? Does it vary in thickness? Where does it point? Where
            does it start and end? These are all important things to think about when assessing the lines in a work of
            art.</dd>
        <dt>Shape</dt>
        <dd>Shape refers to the two-dimensional aspects of a work. Think circles and squares and triangles. A shape is a
            space that lines make together, forming a fenced off area. What kinds of shapes do you see?</dd>
        <dt>Form</dt>
        <dd>This is the depth of a work. It can be literal as in the 3d form of a sculpture, or a trick of the eye in
            the way that an artist can paint something that looks like it's going back in space.</dd>
        <dt>Color</dt>
        <dd>Color is made up of hue, value, and saturation. The hue is the broad answer to the question "what color is
            that?" Perhaps the answer would just be "green." The value is its lightness or darkness. The saturation is
            how vibrant the color is.</dd>
        <dt>Tone/Value</dt>
        <dd>This is how light or dark any part of a work is, areas big or small. Controlling tone is what creates the
            illusion of form.</dd>
        <dt>Texture</dt>
        <dd>That's what you'll feel if you touch the work. Bumpy, smooth, sharp, and things like that. You won't usually
            be touching an artwork, but if you can see it well then you can usually infer the texture.</dd>
        <dt>Space</dt>
        <dd>Space refers to the stuff that's there and the stuff that isn't. Think of a window. How big is the window?
            The window divides the work into negative space(the hole that the window creates in the wall) and positive
            space (the wall itself).</dd>
